# Humaine Snippets

This repository contains a collection of code snippets designed for use within Jupyter notebooks on Kubeflow. These snippets aim to streamline and enhance the machine learning experimentation process by providing reusable code blocks for common tasks.

## Overview

Kubeflow Notebooks offer a robust environment for developing and deploying machine learning models directly within Kubernetes clusters. By leveraging these snippets, users can:

- **Automate Pipeline Creation:** Simplify the process of converting notebook code into Kubeflow Pipelines, facilitating reproducible and scalable workflows.
- **Visualize Outputs:** Utilize built-in functions to render outputs such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and markdown directly within the Kubeflow Pipelines UI.
- **Manage Dependencies:** Efficiently handle package installations and environment configurations to ensure consistency across different runs.

## Repository Structure

- **`notebook_snippets/`**: This directory houses individual Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a specific functionality or task within the Kubeflow ecosystem.

## Getting Started

To integrate these snippets into your Kubeflow environment:

**Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hua-humaine/humaine_snippets.git
   ```
